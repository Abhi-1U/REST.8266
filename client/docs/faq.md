# Frequently Asked Questions

??? faq "Why Open Source ?"  
    In the journey of developing REST.8266, I opened up myself to the idea of 'Open Source' and never looked back.  
     I enjoy the perks of having open source project and give life to this project; rather than keep it to myself.

??? faq "Why Use REST.8266 ?"
	REST.8266 is developed with a different mindset and approach to microcontrollers. Some Features in favour are :
	
	* Zero External Dependencies
	* Pure MicroPython Implementation 
	* RESTful architecture
	* Asynchronous Server
    * Good Documentation

??? faq "Why go RESTful ?"
    Going RESTful was a very different approach to the way we use microcontrollers and access its features, ESP 8266 might be a small device but with a good software implementation can work wonders.
    
??? faq "What is ESP 8266?"
	A low cost Microcontroller with WiFi support built in ESP 8266 can be bought in two forms either like a stand-alone development board or as an additional extension(module) board for other microcontrollers.
