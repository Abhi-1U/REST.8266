Restful Web-services play a major role in our day to day life. We use them without even noticing and thinking about it. Cloud Computing architectures are built upon Web-Services and increase the possibilities one could do on the web.  
    
Micro-Controllers have traditionally been used for specific hardware applications and with the advent of new generation Micro-Controllers such as ESP8266 and ESP32 WiFi connectivity is also available.
    
Thus _"REST.8266"_ aims to bridge the gap between Micro-Controller Interface through Web-Service Style Resource Architecture. This enables the ESP8266 based Micro-Controllers to be controlled efficiently with Web-Interfaces.
