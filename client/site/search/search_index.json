We use them without even noticing and thinking about it. Cloud Computing architectures are built upon Web-Services and increase the possibilities one could do on the web. Micro-Controllers have traditionally been used for specific hardware applications and with the advent of new generation Micro-Controllers such as ESP8266 and ESP32 WiFi connectivity is also available. Thus \"REST.8266\" aims to bridge the gap between Micro-Controller Interface through Web-Service Style Resource Architecture. This enables the ESP8266 based Micro-Controllers to be controlled efficiently with Web-Interfaces.","title":"Home"},{"location":"Release/","text":"","title":"Release"},{"location":"clock/","text":"Clock Clock Timezone : Date : / / / Time : : : Day Of Year : Clock Time NTP Sync","title":"Clock"},{"location":"cpu/","text":"CPU Frequency CPU Freq Current CPU Frequency : CPU Frequency Change CPU Frequency Change Freq New CPU Frequency : Choose CPU Frequency : 80 Mhz 160 Mhz Change Frequency","title":"CPU"},{"location":"device/","text":"Device Details Device Unique ID : Board : CPU Architecture : External ROM : Bytes External RAM : Bytes Firmware : Node Name : Release : Version : Machine : SysName : Device Details Reset Device Reset Reset Machine WebREPL Activate WebREPL Activate WebREPL","title":"Device"},{"location":"faq/","text":"Frequently Asked Questions Why Open Source ? In the journey of developing REST.8266, I opened up myself to the idea of 'Open Source' and never looked back. I enjoy the perks of having open source project and give life to this project; rather than keep it to myself. Why Use REST.8266 ? REST.8266 is developed with a different mindset and approach to microcontrollers. Some Features in favour are : Zero External Dependencies Pure MicroPython Implementation RESTful architecture Asynchronous Server Good Documentation Why go RESTful ? Going RESTful was a very different approach to the way we use microcontrollers and access its features, ESP 8266 might be a small device but with a good software implementation can work wonders. What is ESP 8266? A low cost Microcontroller with WiFi support built in ESP 8266 can be bought in two forms either like a stand-alone development board or as an additional extension(module) board for other microcontrollers.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Why Open Source ?
